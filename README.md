This project is a rebuild of a personal tool, redesigned to explore modern frontend architecture, data modeling and testable application logic.

I studied the publicly available data structures and logic to understand the complex game data, dependency relationships, calculation flow and normalisation - then rebuilt the functionality using my a different architecture and React based UI.

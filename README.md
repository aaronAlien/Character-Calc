## Project History


This is a reimplementation of a fun, personal project built earlier in my learning journey.

**Original Version**
- _vanilla javascript_
- _simple public api data_

**Current Version**
- _React + Vite_
- _Studied the [Paimon.moe project](https://github.com/MadeBaruna/paimon-moe) (MIT) to understand its data structures and logic, then integrated the relevant data into this project_
- _Reimplemented the original Svelte logic in React_
- _Rebuilt the functionality in React using a different architecture_
- _Native unit testing_
- _AI-assisted analysis and refactoring_
